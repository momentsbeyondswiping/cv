  <p>Devin has more than 10 years of extensive hands on, in the field, and project management experience.

Having led 150+ employees at once, managing and completing more than 5 million dollars in projects, dealing face to face with clients, problem solving, and exceeding expectations is his forte.

He has completed projects for Adam Sandler, the president of TD bank, the president of Nestle, Tim Hortons, & Parmalat, the president of the Monte Carlo hotel chain, the president of Cara Group, one of the three partners in Blackberry, the president of San Remo Bakery, Oliver Jewelry & many, many more.

All of his education received while travel from major city to major city around the southern states.

Devin has specialized his last 6 years in the swimming pool industry analyzing profits/losses, efficiencies and structural engineering / water hydraulics with Gib-San Pool & Landscape Creations, Canada’s #1 pool company, rated 9th across North America.

Mr. Gosselin moved on to develop his own online social platform which is still in early development and testing. He aims to dominate his niche.

In spare time, Devin studies computer coding languages and business. He creates a fair balance between work life and family time. When not working, you can likely find him north of the city with his son and daughter doing a variety of outdoor activities. “Nature is a true healer” says Devin.

Three clear goals Devin makes very public is his intention to “Optimize Lives. Optimize Businesses. Optimize the Future.”
